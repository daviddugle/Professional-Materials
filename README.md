# Professional-Materials

**Overview**

This was fun to try with a new framework. There were things that I liked and disliked about Bulma. I felt like they tied my hands a few times when I wanted to change colors of nav bar elements. For the most part it was pretty intuitive and I will have to spend some more time tyring other things out with them. I am more of a hands on type of person so that is going to be the best way I learn.

**Resources used**

*jQuery

*Google Font
